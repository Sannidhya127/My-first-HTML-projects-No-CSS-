<p>There are millions of living entity in the world. So to study systematically, biologists have identified, named and grouped the organisms on the basis of certain common features. Scientist <b>Robert Whittaker</b> in 1969 proposed a <b><u>Five Kingdom Classification</u></b> of the living world:<br>
<li>Monera
<li>Protista
<li>Fungi
<li>Plantae
<li>Animalia<br><br>
             In this project we are going to discuss about the Plantae Kingdom.Virtually all living creatures depend on plants to survive. Through photosynthesis plants convert energy from sunlight into food and stores as carbohydrate.Plants also provide Oxygen to breathe and also absorbs Carbondioxide from the air.Currently there are 260,000 plant species in the world.</p>
