Sannidhya was born in Maryland Nursing Home, Kolkata. I, Sannidhya don't exactly know what happened when I was born because I cannot remember it, but I can tell the things which I remember. By the way let me tell you some things before getting into my history, geography, biology. The things which you are reading now were actually coded in a very complex html format. I have been learning html for a month or two from different apps and Google as my father did not know much about html. Also I have learnt Greek in the English dialect. This type of dialects are used by the spy agencies and I got this idea of learning Greek from a detective Novel, namely  Badshahi Angti by Satyajit Ray. Anyways let's begin.<br>
So as I told you earlier that I don't remember much from my birth. But there are some events I that I heard from my parents like I was crying like anything (I know that all babies cry), I kept my fist always open.
