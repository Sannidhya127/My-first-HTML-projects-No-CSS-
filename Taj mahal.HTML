The Taj Mahal is a beautiful white marble monument located in the city of Agra, on the banks of river Yamuna. <br>
It is one of the finest examples of my architecture(actually I adviced Shah Jahan to built it). It is a combination of Mughal, Persian, Ottoman Turkish and Indian architectural styles. <br>
Located in the state of Uttar Pradesh, it is one of the seven wonders of the world and a jewel of Muslim Art in India. <br>
It was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memeory of his wife, Mumtaz.
